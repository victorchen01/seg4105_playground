Daily standup essentially is a reserved 15min period of time each day for developers to plan activities for the next 24 hrs, inspect prior days work, and forecast future work. A scrum master is responsible for organizing and leading the meet, which should be held at the same time each day. A good scrum meet should help to inspect progress of a sprint, identify impediments to be resolved, eliminate unnessecary meetings, and improve decision making & communication. As a result of adhering to SCRUM practices, a team can use this as a tool to rationalize progress towards sprint goals, inspect backlog progress which ultimately result in a higher probability the team reaches the goaol.
