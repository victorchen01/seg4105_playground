What I learned:
Common problem in approach of most software developers is that relying only on tests, most defects are detected late and there is usually a fix-fail rate of about 10-15%. 
This will lead to developers needing to spend time reworking previous designs, which can then lead to unstable changes, wasted time/capital and delaying the delivery of software.
This cost of rework can take up a non-insignificant percentage of a project budget, studies showed that 40-50% of time is spent on avoidable rework rather than anything value added.
Therefore there should be controls put in place to minimize the risk of such issues. Software development process costs should be measured. 
This is why standards were developed in regards to quality models and assurance. Reviews can be conducted to present processes to critical parties for examination and approval.
