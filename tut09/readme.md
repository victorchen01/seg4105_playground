What I learned:
Common problem in approach of most software developers is that relying only on tests, most defects are detected late only in testing and there is usually a fix-fail rate of about 10-15%. 
This will lead to developers needing to spend time reworking previous designs, which can then lead to unstable changes, wasted time/capital and delaying the delivery of software.
This cost of rework can take up a non-insignificant percentage of a project budget, studies showed that 40-50% of time is spent on avoidable rework rather than anything value added.
Therefore there should be controls put in place to minimize the risk of such issues. Software development process costs should be measured. 
This is why standards were developed in regards to quality models and assurance. Reviews can be conducted to present processes to critical parties for examination and approval. 
Teams can also use walkthroughs or inspections to review activities and make changes of specification or systems when needed.
Joint Committee for ICT develops the standardization guidelines, created ISO/IEC 291100 to create frameworks around softwrae development.
In case study examples such as Raytheon, discovered the success of adhering to these structures as they decreased project cost percentages from abover 30% to around 5% in a span of a decade.
