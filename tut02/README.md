   When shaping features, its important to maintain a balance between rigid details and vagueness. There should be enough information for developers to understand the direction and context without over specifying design requirements. This lets designers have room to improve but all elements of the solution exist to minimize unknowns. It's also useful to set boundaries on what needs to be accomplished with the given timeframe

3)
   Effective project shaping begins with clearly defining project boundaries. Whether it's a minor improvement or a major overhaul, establish project scope and objectives before diving into solutions. Next, assess an idea's feasibility and value. Determine its significance and allocate time using an "appetite" concept. To tackle complex problems, focus on specific issues and use cases driving requests, avoiding vague "redesigns" or "refactorings."

4)
  To move at the right speed, the team must have the right people to work with and level of detail must be concrete enough to make progress on a specific solution without
getting dragged down into fine details. Two prototyping techniques can be used, breadboarding and fat marker sketches, which allows quick creation of flows and easy comparison. Simple sketches of key components, with words and lines to show context and state changes.

5)
  When shaping a project with a fixed time frame, it's essential to meticulously scrutinize the concept to eliminate any potential pitfalls. Even if the project appears feasible based on prior experience, a single unforeseen challenge can disrupt the timeline and budget. While unforeseen challenges are inevitable, thorough shaping reduces risk by ensuring well-understood, independent project components that fit together seamlessly. In essence, well-shaped work minimizes the likelihood of extended timelines and unexpected complications, creating a thin-tailed probability distribution for project completion.
